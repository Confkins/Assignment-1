C14452482 OOP Assignment 1

I have a main program file along with 5 separate classes (With Data() as a superclass and the graphs as sub-classes).

The main() file simply calls classes, class methods, and deals with user input.

In the Data() class, I read in two set of data I got from the world data repository which I modified myself to work with processing. 
I read these files into arrays which I then sorted alphabetically. (For neatness' sake). The arrays are then separated into two,
a string array and a float array. In this class are several sorting methods used by the various graphs

In the Graph() class, I draw four line graphs based off the two data sets: Bottom ten, and top ten countries.
This class also holds methods for drawing points and displaying relavent data when a mouse is hoveringover it.

In the Full_trend() class, I draw three graphs: Murder rate trend, GDP trend, and an overlap of the two.
This class utilises the entire dataset.

In the Bar_graph() Class, I draw two bar graphs with the data, Similar to the Full_Trend Graph.

The Menu() class simply draws the menu. 

Included with the assignment files are the two data files, my initial readme file and this explanation text.

I hoope this is okay, thanks for reading!
